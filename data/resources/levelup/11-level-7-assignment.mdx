# Assignments

## Assignment 1

Make a circuit that has 1 RGB LED, 3 LDR sensors (or Potentiometers), and a button. When a **push button is pressed**, the LED should cycle between red, blue, and green colors. There should be one LDR/Potentiometer for each color to **control its brightness** when it is active.

## Assignment 2

Generate a PWM wave of any desired **% Duty Cycle** from a **Non-PWM supporting pin** (Pins other than 3,5,6,9,10,11) and demonstrate the square wave on an **oscilloscope**. Pick a convenient Frequency for your square wave.

## Assignment 3

Task :- Make a 4 wheeled bot as shown in the figure.

This week you have to use your creativity for the part designing , but emphasis will be on the assembly and the type of mates being used.
Guidelines for Parts :-
(i) The dimensions of these parts are available online and you can use the specified dimensions. But no marks will be given for this. It is just to make your task simpler.

Guidelines for Assembly :-
(i) Make sure mates are realistic. Eg: A wheel mounted onto the bot should be capable of rotation.
(ii) Make sure dimensions are appropriate. Eg: The wheel should have proper dimensions to fit onto the shaft it's being mounted on. Other dimensions like length of chassis or diameter of wheel are left to your discretion.

Guidelines for Motion Study :-
(i) Give the same rpm to all motors and show the wheels spinning.
(ii) People using Fusion show an animation of the wheels spinning.

Guidelines for submission :-
(i) Use .sldasm and .sldprt file format for the files and include a video recording of the animation not longer than 10 sec.
(ii) Use native Fusion 360 format .f3d format and include a video recording of the animation not longer than 10 sec. (NO NEED to convert into .iges/.igs formats)
