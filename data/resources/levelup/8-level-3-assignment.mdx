# Assignment

## Electronics

Question:
Make a count up timer from 0 to 7. Represent the numbers in 3-bit binary digits using 3 LEDs. On running your code the LEDs should light up to represent 1 and switch off to represent 0. You must also include a push-button to reset the counter whenever you want.

To submit the assignment, you will need to make your project public in TinkerCAD and then share its link in the form. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLPs1PCvhck) will guide you how to generate a link for your project.
