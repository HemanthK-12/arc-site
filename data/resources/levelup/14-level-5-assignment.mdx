# Assignments

### Assignment 1

Calculate the velocity of an object moving with constant velocity using the HC SR04 Sensor. Assume that the velocity vector of the object points directly towards or away from the HC SR04 transmitter/receiver. (Ignore Doppler Effect)

### Assignment 2

Use this velocity calculated in previous question to calculate the distance of the object after a given time interval. Measure the distance using the HC SR 04 sensor and calculate the error. (Ignore Doppler Effect)

### Assignment 3

How would you measure the speed of sound in water using the HC SR04 Sensor and the Arduino UNO? What other materials are required? Try to think solutions as creative as possible. -->

### Assignment 3

You have to simulate a mini-segway (2 wheels only) that avoids obstacles. It takes a 90 degrees(approx) turn on every obstacle detected. For detecting an object you should use 2 PIR Sensors, one for detecting an obstacle on the left side and one for detecting an obstacle on the right side.
The path of the segway should be as follows -

1.  It goes straight until no object is detected on either side.
2.  It takes a 90 degree left turn if the object is detected on the
    right side and then goes straight.
3.  It takes a 90 degree right turn if the object is detected on the
    left side and then goes straight.

An example path (Approximate path) -

Specifications :
Radius of wheel = 30 cm
Distance between two wheels = 1 m
At All points rpm of both wheels should be approx 5000 rpm.
Bonus points for those who reduce their rpm to approx 2000 rpm while turning.

Assumptions -

1.  You can assume that the motors can reach 0 rpm in a negligible
    amount of time.

2.  There is sufficient friction so that no slipping takes place.

The time taken by the segway to rotate 90 degrees can be calculated as follows -

Your setup on TinkerCAD should look something like this -

**NOTE - WHEELS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDES**
