1. Print your intro on the Serial Monitor.
2. Swap the last two numbers of your ID. (Don't Hardcode swapped numbers).
3. An H-bridge is an electronic circuit that switches the polarity of a voltage applied to a load. These circuits are often used in robotics and other applications to allow DC motors to run forwards or backwards. Now you have to use 2 LEDs. 1st LED should glow in one configuration & 2nd LED should glow in other configuration of the H-bridge.
