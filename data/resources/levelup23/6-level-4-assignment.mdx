# Assignments

## Assignment 1

Make a circuit that has 1 RGB LED, 3 LDR sensors (or Potentiometers), and a button. When a **push button is pressed**, the LED should cycle between red, blue, and green colors. There should be one LDR/Potentiometer for each color to **control its brightness** when it is active.

## Assignment 2

Generate a PWM wave of any desired **% Duty Cycle** from a **Non-PWM supporting pin** (Pins other than 3,5,6,9,10,11) and demonstrate the square wave on an **oscilloscope**. Pick a convenient Frequency for your square wave.

## CAD Assignment 1:

Design a Fidget Spinner,

It is expected that the learners must complete these three assignments in CAD on their own and referencing the videos must be last resort.
However, when you complete the design, they must use different colours and textures at the end.

## CAD Assignment 2:

Design an Airplane Model,

## CAD Assignment 3:

Design a Robot Gripper,

## CAD Assignment 4:

Kudos to completing all three assignments. Now, you have reached a stage where you must start critical thinking about things from your daily life for progression in CAD modelling. Start with designing any real-world object from your life, and you can always showcase it in your LinkedIn posts. (Donâ€™t forget to tag the company whose software you have used)
