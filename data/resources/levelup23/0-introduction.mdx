- **Why do Level Up?** <br />
  Level Up is a prerequisite for getting into ARC, and is a part of the induction process. Participants need to go through the resources for Levels 0-5, which are uploaded on the website. It is a self-paced course, which means that there is no specific deadline to finish any level. People who finish atleast till Level 5 will be eligible to sit for the interview. Levels 6 and 7 are additional resources which everyone is advised to go through, but you won't be evaluated on concepts of those levels.
  **_Level 7 will be released shortly._**

- **Should we submit the assignments?** <br />
  Each Level has a couple of assignments which the participants have to go through. However, we will not keep track of the assignments. We will test the participants directly in the interview.

- **When will the interview be held?** <br />
  The interview for ARC inductions will be scheduled after 22 batch compres. The exact dates for the same will be announced later. As mentioned before, only participants who complete all 5 levels will be eligible to sit for the interview.
