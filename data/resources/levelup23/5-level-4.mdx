## Introduction

Onshape is an online enthusiast-centric CAD software that is free for students. It provides us access to CAD tools on the go, i.e. without the hassle of installing big and hefty software. It works on the web and doesnâ€™t require any robust computing requirements as that of gaming PCs. The only important thing is that you MUST have a mouse to work with CAD-related software.
Revamped Tutorial Series has been attached, which must be followed religiously to understand the basics of CAD. This knowledge can be directly applied to other professional CAD software, which has a different interface or workflow.
