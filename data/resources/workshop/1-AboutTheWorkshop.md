# Introduction

<Image src="/static/images/resources/Day 0/arc.jpg" alt="LED" width='800' height='500'/>

Automation and Robotics Club introduces to you its flagship event of the year, Robotics 101, where we take you through a world filled with electronics and other exciting tools you will learn in the 3-day workshop held in BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. This workshop will give you hands-on experience with physical components, etc.

## The workshop will cover concepts such as:

- Installing and Using Arduino IDE
- Tinkering with various sensors offline and on tinkercad
- Uploading code onto an Arduino Uno board
- Arduino-specific C Programming
- Electronic Components and their working

## The above will comprise the essential knowledge and skills required to complete a capstone project. The kit provided will support doing projects such as:

1. Line Follower Bot
2. Light Seeking Bot
3. Obstacle Avoider
4. Radar and many more

The technical workshop will be based on a physical hands-on kit that the participants can purchase from our portal and has zero prerequisites. The participants will be exposed to the fundamentals of programming, electronics, and design which make up the foundation of robotics.

## Schedule:

- Day 0 - Software Setup and Distribution of Kits: 02:00 pm - 05:00 pm
- Day 1 - Electronics: 09:00 am - 12:00 pm
- Day 2 - Electronics: 09:00 am - 12:00 pm
- Day 3 - Capstone project: 09:00 am - 12:00 pm
  A certificate will be issued upon completing the assignments and the final capstone project contingent on having 70% attendance in the live sessions. The certificates will be electronically mailed to the participants at the end of the workshop.
  Given the hands-on nature of the workshop, the participants are encouraged to procure the kit around which the workshop has been designed.

## Electronic Components:

- Students will be made to work with sensors and devices such as Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensors, Arduino Unos, Resistors, ICs, Multimeters, Potentiometers, and IR Sensors.
-

## Workshop Arrangements and Other Details:

- Students will have to get their laptops to work on these devices
- At least one laptop is needed per kit
- Extension cords will be provided
- Power backup in case of power failure
- Kit distribution shall occur on the first day of the workshop at the venue.

## Pre-requisites:

There are no prerequisites for attending the workshop

## Duration:

3 Days

## About ARC

The Automation and Robotics Club (ARC) is a part of the Technical Senate of BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. If curiosity and innovation are your assets, you've found the right place for yourself. We take up promising challenges, workshops, and projects that combine electronics, mechanics, and programming. The only prerequisite to joining us - is the desire to quench your curiosity and express yourself.

## Workshop Requirements

You will need the following:

- Laptop with Arduino IDE installed
- Line Follower Workshop Kit (Components listed below)
- Basic C programming knowledge is helpful but not mandatory. (CS F111: Computer Programming at BITS will suffice)

If you have not completed the course or are looking to brush up some concepts, worry not! We will be providing resources for the same as soon as you register.
